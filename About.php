            Mentoring Program for the Computer Science Department. As a part of MTSU's
            <i>Quest for Student Success</i>, this program seeks to empower and
            aid students not only in their own academic acheivements, but also in their
            own career paths. Students can seek free mentorship through this program,
             while other students provide mentoring, lifting both to higher tiers of success.
            The program is run and administrated by faculty &amp; staff of the
            Computer Science Department.

                How about Ruby on Rails or OpenGL?
                <br>
                Are you having difficulty with one of your classes?
                <br>

            <p>
                <pre>            </pre>Becoming a mentor will give you the opportunity
                to share your skills, help a fellow student learn or understand something new,
                and even learn a few new things yourself!
                <br>
                Did you spend the summer break learning web development?
                <br>
                Did you really enjoy Algorithms &amp; Data Structures last semester?
                <br>
                Signing up as a peer mentor is a great opportunity to
                network within the community and share what you know!
                Mentors also provide their availability when they sign up, so everyone's schedule
                is un-fooled around with. Becoming a mentor looks great on a resume, and is even
                better for leadership skills.
